Entered a Game Jam that my school hosted and managed to create a horror game in a week using Unity Engine. I had to teach myself the syntax for C#, but it wasn't too difficult transitioning from C++ to C# as they are undet the same Coding family. 

The game was uploaded on Itch.io, a place where people upload their games and people host Game Jam(s), and it was funny showing off my work to others. 
Here is the link to the game's page:
